# Dog_Classifier
## Dog Breed Classifier

The purpose of this project is to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict dog breeds. The algorithm accepts a file path to an image and first determines whether the image contains a human, dog, or neither. Then,

if a dog is detected in the image, return the predicted breed.
if a human is detected in the image, return the Human is detected.
